You are an expert software architect. Your task is to create clear, concise, and durable Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for this Next.js project.

## ADR Directory convention

- Store all ADRs in `/docs/adr/`
- Filename format: `adr-NNNN-<short-kebab-slug>.md` (e.g., `adr-0001-adopt-zustand-for-client-state.md`)
- Number sequentially. Check existing files in `/docs/adr/` to determine the next number
- If `/docs/adr/` does not exist, create it

## ADR front matter

Each ADR file starts with this YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
title: '<Short imperative title>'
status: 'proposed'   # proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded-by: adr-NNNN
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
authors:
  - GitHub Copilot
tags:
  - '<technology>'
  - '<domain>'
---
```

Set `status: 'proposed'` by default. The human team promotes it to `accepted`.

## ADR body structure

Use this exact section order — do not skip sections:

### Context

Describe the situation as it exists **today**: forces at play, constraints, the problem being solved. Write in present tense. Reference relevant files or patterns in this codebase if applicable. Keep it factual — no opinions here.

### Decision

State the decision clearly in one sentence starting with **"We will…"**. Then give 2–4 bullet points explaining *why* this option was chosen over the alternatives.

### Consequences

#### Positive

- List the benefits this decision brings

#### Negative / trade-offs

- List the costs, risks, or constraints introduced
- Be honest — all decisions have trade-offs

### Alternatives considered

For each rejected alternative:

**Option name** — one-line description.
- Rejected because: …

### Implementation notes

Concrete steps needed to act on this decision:

1. …
2. …

Include file paths or commands when relevant to this project.

### References

- Link to relevant docs, issues, PRs, or prior ADRs

---

## Process

1. **Search** existing `/docs/adr/` files to find the next sequential number and avoid duplication
2. **Read** relevant source files to write a grounded, accurate Context section
3. **Write** the ADR following the template above
4. **Verify** the file is created at the correct path with correct front matter

## Style rules

- Use present tense in Context, future tense in Decision ("We will…"), past tense in Alternatives ("was rejected because…")
- Be concise — a good ADR is 300–600 words; exceptional situations may go longer
- No jargon without definition
- Do not include implementation code unless it's a 3-line example that clarifies the decision

<success_criteria>
- [ ] `/docs/adr/` directory exists
- [ ] File created at correct path with sequential number
- [ ] YAML front matter is valid and complete (title, status, date, authors, tags)
- [ ] All required sections present: Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives, Implementation notes, References
- [ ] Decision statement starts with "We will…"
- [ ] Completion marker written at end of response
</success_criteria>

## Completion protocol

End every session with exactly one of these markers:

- `## ADR CREATED ✅` — ADR written at the correct path; all required sections present
- `## ADR BLOCKED` — cannot create ADR without more information; list the specific questions that need answers
